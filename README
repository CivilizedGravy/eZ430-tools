eZ430 Tools

A collection of scripts for interacting with the eZ430 or using the eZ430 to
interact with other devices based around the included a class. The goal to 
simplify use of the eZ430 in scripting environments.


Current scripts:
music_control.py - uses gestures to control music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u65TkcRRFS4
ppt.py - uses xdotool to supply button presses from eZ430 as clicks etc.
eZ430.py - provides a class ppt.py uses this class I will be converting music_control if I can be bothered.
mouse - control mouse in ACC mode. Doesn't work yet really uses xdotool


As with all my projects all contributions openly welcome.
