eZ430 Tools

A collection of scripts for interacting with the eZ430 or using the eZ430 to interact with other devices.
Including a class to simplify use of the eZ430.


Current scripts:
music_control.py - uses gestures to control music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u65TkcRRFS4
ppt.py - uses xdotool to supply button presses from eZ430 as clicks etc.
eZ430.py - provides a class ppt.py uses this class I will be converting music_control if I can be bothered.



As with all my projects all contributions openly welcome.
